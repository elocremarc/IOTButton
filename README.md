# Simple IOT Button

This is just a basic on off button for use in IOT applications for the Raspbery Pi. This runs a simple web page that on a webserver like Nginx/Appache the code is based on Bootstrap 4 which is a good CSS template for mobile IOT buttons. The core functiality is based on JQUERY using AJAX to request a PHP page which runs a simple GPIO commands from the terminal using the Wiring Pi library. For more information on setting up a webserver follow the Raspberypi Documentation https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/
